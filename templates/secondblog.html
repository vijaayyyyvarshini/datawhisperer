        <p>I am going to start with a curious mind. Hence, the question? How long did it take to solve the rubrics cube when we were smaller? Maybe, a month?
        6 months? 1 year? Well, all of this depends on the practice and how curious you are enough to solve it quickly. 
        If you are not really faster into learning how to solve it, then you might take your own time with it and solve it only when you wish to.
        But, if you are really into learning how to solve them, the you might just a few weeks and you will get it done somehow!!
        </p>

        <p>My cousin recently learned how to solve it within weeks, by referring to books and watching youtube videos for the hints and tricks. However, I remember I took sometime to solve it, as I was not really into it.</p>

        <p> However, playing with puzzles in grade 4 helped me to enjoy it. I used to sit for hours, thinking and joining all the puzzle pieces together. They gave me a new definition for curiosity. 
            That is when I realised rubrik cubes can also be solved if you solve in the way you can. This allowed me to understand all problems have solutions. 
            My interest in maths also ascended. I went from an average student to an A student in maths. 
            I practiced more and enjoyed all the problems. It made me feel like I was getting out from a maze. 
            Then, I was introduced to the concepts of programming and my imagination went wild. I loved using programming as a coping mechanism to solve problems.
       </p>

       <p>
        My first step in practicing and solving problems was using Hacker Rank. It was the instagram for me. I spent hours and hours in it, trying to solve different types of questions.
        I used to fail in most of them but then as I kept encountering more problems, it did work out for me. I would say, consistency is the key. Just because you cannot do it initially, does not mean you wont be able to do at all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, I was in my Data Engineering class and my professor asked us to solve a puzzle. It was just a simple puzzle that required some logical skills. However, me being me, I wanted to make use of algorithms in it. 
        I came up with a solution to solve the question. 
        </p>
       <p>The question is, "How to cut a cake into 16 equal halves with just 5 cuts?"</p> 

       <p>This is the solution I came up with - </p>

       <p>
        <p>Step 1: Cut the cake vertically in two halves.</p>
       <p>Step 2: Cut the cake horizontally that will create 2 equal layers.</p>
        <p>Step 3: Rotate the cake, and cut down vertically to the center of the cake. This will create four
            equal quarters.</p>
        <p>Step 4: Rotate the cake again, and now cut it horizontally across the top of the cake. This will
            create eight equal eighths.</p>
        <p>Step 5: Finally, make a vertical cut down the center of each eighth. This will create 16 equal
            pieces.</p>

            <div class="image-container">

            </div>

        <p>Therefore, the moral of today's learning is: Be consistent in what you do, and you will see the results definitely.</p>
